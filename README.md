OPERAI (Oil Palm Environment Recognition AI) - Object Detection GUI using YOLOv3

## Overview

OPERAi is a real-time object detection application using YOLOv3 and OpenCV, integrated with a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter. The application processes live video feed from a webcam, detects objects, and allows users to take screenshots of detected objects with a timestamp.

## Features

- Real-time Object Detection: Utilizes YOLOv3 for fast and accurate object recognition.
- Graphical User Interface: Built using Tkinter for ease of use.
- Live Camera Feed: Captures video input from the default webcam.
- Screenshot Functionality: Saves snapshots of detected objects with a timestamp.
- Customizable UI Elements: Displays logos and instructions within the GUI.
- Detection Control: Start, stop, and capture frames with buttons.

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Tkinter (built-in with Python)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OPERAi.git
    cd OPERAi
    ```

2. Install required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install opencv-python numpy
    ```

### Running the Application

1. Execute the script:
    ```sh
    python opera_ai.py
    ```

2. Utilize the GUI controls:
    - **Start Detection**: Initiates real-time object detection.
    - **Stop Detection**: Pauses object detection.
    - **Screenshot**: Captures and saves a snapshot with detected objects.
    - **Quit**: Exits the application.

## File Structure

ðŸ“‚ OPERAi

| File Name        | Description                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| `opera_ai.py`   | Main application script       |
| `yolov3.weights`| YOLOv3 model weights         |
| `yolov3.cfg`    | YOLOv3 configuration file    |
| `coco.names`    | COCO class labels            |
| `logo.png`      | Primary logo for the GUI     |
| `logo2.png`     | Secondary logo               |

## Screenshot Storage

Captured images are automatically stored in a folder named OPERAi_screenshot on the user's Desktop. The filenames include timestamps and detected object names for easy reference.
